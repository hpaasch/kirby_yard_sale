I did the back-end for this project, setting up RESTful API endpoints for a
front-end student to connect with. We shifted the code to a new repository on
GitHub late in the project. It's available here. https://github.com/kirby-munson/yard-sale
The project is live here: http://repurpose.herokuapp.com/

We were the only students in our cohort to work together. She provided design
work on my presidential dinner party app.

Working together provided a whole new set of challenges for us, which is what
we expected and why we chose to work together. We learned to coordinate our
pushes and pulls from GitHub. We figured out how to deal with merge conflicts.
We had to learn to communicate even though we learned entirely different
languages.
